I find MVVM hard and Dynamo's implementation of it confusing. The SpringsUI package represents some of my coding brain-farts and work-arounds that worked fine for me. It by no means reflects the *proper* way to do node model development but might hopefully give you some ideas on how to work around an issue.

### HOW TO BUILD

- Have Dynamo installed
- If Dynamo is not in the default location *(C:\Program Files\Dynamo\Dynamo Core\1.3)*, change the DynPath variable in the *csproj files.
- Have the package installed or use the contents of the included package folder
- Build
